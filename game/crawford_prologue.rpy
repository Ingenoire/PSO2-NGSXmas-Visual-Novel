    c.c "...Dark Falz was transformed into a very horny VTuber."

    c.c "And she's the reason why Central Cannon fled."
    c.c "Apparently without central cannon, she's now been abducting arks defenders to fall in love with them."
    c.c "She's a crazed sex obsessed person, that's for sure."
    c.c "You can see her... passion, in the designs of her DOLLs. Tentacles, large butts, lots of water... I can go on."
    c.c "We've had trouble trying to convert the other VTubers back into normal, but we can't reach Dark Falz's heart."
    c.c "And the Youtuber who made that device, fled from the scene of the crime."
    c.c "We have to do this the hardest way possible, so listen up Meteorn."

    c.c "But she's going to seduce you like no other person would."
    c.c "Everyone we've sent has been seduced by her."

    c.c idle "A dangerous pheromone is emitting from her."
    c.c "It not only disables every weapon you'd carry, but in addition..."
    c.c "...the pheromone prevents you from trash talking her."
    c.c "The only options you'll be able to say are going to be very nice words."
    c.c screaming "If it wasn't for this pheromone, I'd do this myself!"
    c.c idle "But... I know that you, Meteorn, have a way with clean words."

    c.c "So be careful."
    
    c.c "..."
    c.c "One more thing."
    c.c "If you stay too long within her den, the pheromones will overtake your will."
    c.c "Should that happen, you're never going to return home."

    
    c.c "Alright, get moving."
